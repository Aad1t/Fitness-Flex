# Fitness-Flex

Hey, my name is Aadit Gupta and I recently worked on this project, called Fitness Flex at Hack the North 2022 with two other teammates. It is an AI trainer created using open-cv and mediapipe in python. These libraries allowed us to use computer vision that tells one about the angles their body makes while performing any exercise, and how many reps they perform while doing the exercise in front of a web camera. It has a meter to determine whether you are fulling extending your body part in order to fully perform the exercise, hence helping you determine whether you are doing the exercise in a correct manner. This replaces the need to hire a physical trainer, hence saving people's money and time
